Im glad I could find you, and I hope all is well with 
you. Sadly we have little time for pleasantries or 
idle small talk. Things have made a turn for the worse 
between the northern kingdoms and my father predicts the 
bloodshed will spill south in the months ahead...
#You have a firmer grip and a keener eye than any warrior 
under my command and I fear that you can no longer 
spend your talents hunting rabbits and chopping wood for Durir. 
#I know you look up to him, but his silver toungue has 
poisoned your mind with his fairy tales. Even if there where 
an inkling of truth to his nonsense. The threats I speak of 
are real and this war will engulf us all... including your 
little village here... consider what I am telling you...
#When you do decide to leave this place and come and help 
again. You know where to find me.. when the blades start 
crossing and the fog of war decends. I would like to have 
you helping... not fishing...
#I have already spoken to Durir... but there 
is no speaking to that man. He wishes to see you in his house. He 
said you could help and that he would arm you... but I know that 
he twists words to his own benefit... Farewell for now...
