Ahh there you are <PLAYER_NAME>! I couldn't find you anywhere in town.
I have something I wanted to talk to you about...
#Our war-efforts against the Empire of Gul'thran are taking
a heavier toll than we imagined, and peace talk's have fallen 
apart.
#I have personally come to speak to Durir about sending you on a mission 
that could help our cause, you can find him inside his house. Just follow 
this path here. He is expecting you.
#Take heed to his words <PLAYER_NAME>, you have a remarkable ability
to come back alive from almost anything we have you do. 
But luck can only last so long.
#I will return to front and do my part, I wish you a swift journey and 
good luck with yours... take care.
