.... It has been a long time surfacedweller... 
Since I have seen any of your filthy kind venture
into my fortress... let alone my chamber...
# You must be brave to be here... in the dark...
all by yourself... shame for you that the gears have 
been set in motion... the destiny of your world is set in 
stone and it shall ALL come to pass...
# Do not dwell on your hopes of stopping us... as the
Imps that scitter and scatter throughout these halls
are but a fraction of MY army... I myself a pawn in a 
larger army still, that has allied itself with darkness that
will bring an end to your world soon enough...
# But now is not a time for idle conversation... now is a
time for quiet contemplation... and I know a good way to make it
quiet in here so I can get back to it...
