Hello adventurer, I am Bentos. I have been tasked with showing
you what dialogue looks like as well as showing you ranged combat.
#Now that we are done with the former, how's about we get on 
with the latter!?
#The bow on the ground is a gift, and will serve you well, now 
that you have both ranged and melee weapons you can quick change 
between stances by pressing "1" and "2", at least thats the default.
You can change your keybinds from the main menu.
#I have taken the liberty of setting up some targets for you. Hit them
without crossing the line.
I heard them saying you could'nt hit the ground with an arrow, haha! 
which... come to think of it... is true... hmmm... oh my! noone can!
#Remember you can also charge a special hit with bows by holding in the 
right mouse button. This however will consume stamina, so use it carefully.
#Come back and talk to me when you've successfully hit all three targets,
But don't step over that line!
#Ok not bad, but there is one last thing I'd like to tell you...
You really need some pants... Im not judging... It's just...
I'm just happy this is a pixelated world... here have these, I 
always carry an extra pair becau... because nevermind.
#We're done here <PLAYER_NAME>, in the next room is a real foe. We have been 
holding onto it for a while so I think it's... whats the word i'm looking for here...
eager! yes... eager to talk to you. Be careful and apply what you've learned here
to overcoming this challenge.
