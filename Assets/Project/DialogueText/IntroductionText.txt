<PLAYER_NAME>! Just the person I wanted to see, I trust
Reylith has spoken to you but surely not about what we 
want of you this time, else your face would be more contorted... 
#The Empire is starting to take control of Battlefields all 
over the globe, and our troops are spread thin as it is. Reylith
will command our troops best she can and I am recruiting as many
people to "The Insurgency" as I can.
#What we need from you, is to take out targets of high priority
that we can identify and locate. And Reylith has done just that.
#She has managed to identify a General of the Empire called "Tol'tar"
who has been causing us quite a bit of difficulty. We want you to 
deal with him. But that is not all.
#In order to travel to his keep you must first get through the 
mountains, north of here. They are windey and dangerous and many have
gotten lost inside the caves that exist within.
#Just outside my house to the north you will find an entrance to 
the caves, be careful there is an entire throng of imps inside.
#I have heard reports of a powerful magic weilding imp called 
"Qupha" who resides within those caves. Perhaps finding him is a
a good way to find a way through. surely he guards it carefully.
#Once through the mountains travel East and you will find Tol'Tar's
Keep, but be forwarned. He is no push-over.
