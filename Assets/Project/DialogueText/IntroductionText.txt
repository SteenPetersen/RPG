Hello and well met traveller! welcome... to Pixlrelm!
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Durir, and I 
have lived in Pixlrelm my entire life. And although I 
am a two dimension character, you will find...
I am anything but... 
#This world is developing <get it?> and is still in 
it's infancy. In order to make your mark on its 
progress. Please forward all feedback to 
info@pixlrelm.com or to Twitter @Pixlrelm. 
#You can move about using W,S,A,D and aim at things 
with your mouse. if you find something hard to see or 
your line of sight is somehow hindered. Press and hold 
E or Q in order to set the view as you see fit. 'Click'
things that you wish to interact with... or that you 
wish to hit. Aim projectiles with your mouse.
Not now... I'm still talking... pay attention.
#You can also Press 'I' to check out your inventory
so that you can equip and unequip items by interacting
with them.
#Come back to me later, and perhaps I will have more
information for you.
